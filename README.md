# SQL-Practical-Exercises

This repository contains multiple SQL exercises completed using Snowflake's cloud platform. Each folder includes a specific exercise focused on fundamental SQL concepts.


## ðŸ“‚ Exercise 01 - Retail Sales Analysis

Focuses on basic SQL syntax using retail sales data by gender and product category.

- [Objective Description File](https://github.com/Tiyani-Baloyi-Analyst/SQL-Practical-Exercises/blob/main/Exercise%2001/Practical%201%20-%20SQL%20Fundamentals.pdf) Information File - Details the objectives of the exercise and what has to be executed.
- [Sales Dataset CSV File](https://github.com/Tiyani-Baloyi-Analyst/SQL-Practical-Exercises/blob/main/Exercise%2001/retail_sales_dataset.csv) Input Data File - Contains the raw data with all the parameters and dimensions to be used in the exercise. These dimensions include gender, product category and age. 
- [Results with Code Snippets File](https://github.com/Tiyani-Baloyi-Analyst/SQL-Practical-Exercises/blob/main/Exercise%2001/Practical%20Exercise%201_Tiyani%20Baloyi.pdf) Output Results - Shows snippets of the SQL code for each question seperately.
- [Complete SQL Code File](https://github.com/Tiyani-Baloyi-Analyst/SQL-Practical-Exercises/blob/main/Exercise%2001/Practical%20Exercise%201.sql) Output Code - This is the full SQL code completed on Snowflake to address all the objectives of the exercise.


## ðŸ“‚ Exercise 02 - Joins and Subqueries

  Uses multiple tables to explore joins and slightly complex SQL logic. The nature of the exercise still focuses on retail sales analysis which have different tables which were joined together in order to address the objectives. One of the primary mission was to identify which customers purchsaed what kind of products.
